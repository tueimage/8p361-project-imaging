We can use the handy ImageDataGenerator function from the Keras API to do this. Note that the generators are defined within a function that returns them as output arguments. This function will later be called from the main code body. \n"

Organizing the code into functions instead of piling everything up in a single script makes the code more clear to read and understand, and helps reuse functionality that is already implemented. For example, we can use the `get_pcam_generators()` function to create data generators with different batch sizes just by calling the function with a different set of parameters. Or, we can use the `get_model()` function to generate networks with different number of feature maps (see below). \n",

The kernel size and number of filters of the two convolutional layers, and the size of the max pooling regions can be passed as input parameters to the function (however, note that default values are set so the function can be called without parameters). ReLU nonlinearities are used throughout the network, except for the output neuron that is activated with a sigmoid. "
